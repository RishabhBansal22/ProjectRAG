Sample Document for RAG System

This is a sample text document to test the document-based retrieval system.

Introduction:
This document contains information about various topics that can be indexed
and retrieved using the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.

Section 1: Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the 
development of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions or decisions 
based on data. It encompasses various techniques including supervised learning,
unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

Section 2: Natural Language Processing
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that 
focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It involves
teaching computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in
a valuable way.

Section 3: Vector Databases
Vector databases are specialized database systems designed to store and query
high-dimensional vector embeddings. They are essential for semantic search,
recommendation systems, and retrieval-augmented generation applications.

Conclusion:
This sample document demonstrates the basic structure and content that can be
processed by the document loading and indexing pipeline.
